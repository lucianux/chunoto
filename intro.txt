When it comes to securing a digital device, antivirus is the major ingredient factor that comes to mind. It has been essential on desktop computers since the mid 1990’s, but is now just as essential on smartphones and other mobile devices.

Hackers long ago learned that to trick users into thinking they are downloading antivirus to their desktops when they were really just extorting money from them. They are now using similar tricks to infect user’s devices with malware.

Just a few years ago, mobile phones were basic devices that could send and receive voice calls but not do much else. These days, smartphones are about as significant as full-fledged desktop PCs and laptops, and are filled with valuable email messages, contacts, videos, photos, and documents.

People depend on their smartphones every day, and losing the data those devices contain can be as disastrous as suffering through a hard-drive crash on a proper PC. That's why it's important that you back up your phone as regularly and carefully as you do your other devices.
